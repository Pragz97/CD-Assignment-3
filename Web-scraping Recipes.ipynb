       " \" The secrets to a good gumbo aren't anything fancy either, but if you take the time to do them right, your gumbo will be just as good as the ones served in New Orleans.\\n\",\n",
       " \" The first? Make sure to brown the sausage and chicken until they both have crispy caramelization. Secondly, don't fear the roux. Brown is the color of flavor so make sure to stir your vegetable oil and flour mixture until it's reached a true chocolate hue.\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       " ' Gumbo originated in the early 18th century in Louisiana, and is a flavorful stew made up of stock, a\\xa0holy trinity\\xa0of onion, bell pepper, and celery; meat or shellfish, and a thickener—typically a roux, okra, or\\xa0filé powder. A vibrant combination of flavors and textures, this hearty dish is often used as a metaphor for the melting pot of cultures within the state.\\n',\n",
       " \" You may come across a few unique types of gumbo. Creole gumbo, thickened with a light roux and featuring tomatoes, differs from Cajun gumbo, which is thickened with a dark roux, and does not traditionally have tomatoes in the mix. Gumbo z'herbes is another type of gumbo, made vegetarian to be enjoyed during Lent or for other meatless occasions.\\n\",\n",
       " \" Gumbo and jambalaya\\xa0are both staples of Cajun and Creole cuisine, with unique flavor profiles based on who's making the dish. The major difference between the two is how they're served—gumbo is served spooned over rice, while\\xa0jambalaya is cooked with rice as a part of the dish.\\n\",\n",
       " \" Andouille sausage, a holy trinity, Creole seasoning, and bone-in chicken breasts combine for this richly flavored chicken and sausage gumbo your family will ask for on repeat. To make chicken and sausage gumbo, you'll need:\\n\",\n",
       " \" While optional, filé powder is used to flavor and thicken gumbo, and is often used in Louisiana Creole cuisine. It's a seasoning made from dried and ground leaves of North American sassafras trees, with a slightly herbal flavor. It's typically sprinkled over gumbo after cooking to tighten it up and add an earthy flavor, as cooking it too long could cause a stringy result.\\n\",\n",
       " \" The best dishes are worth waiting for, and the slow simmer of this gumbo builds deep flavor for a rich and savory blend of ingredients. Full instructions are below, but here's a brief recap before you get started:\\n\",\n",
       " ' Gumbo is a great make-ahead dish. To make this dish in advance, cook as directed, then cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to two days for the freshest flavor and reheat on the stovetop before serving.\\n',\n",
       " ' Leftover chicken and sausage gumbo will keep in the refrigerator for up to four days. Store in an airtight container, and reheat on the stovetop until heated throughout. You can also reheat small portions in the microwave as needed.\\n',\n",
       " ' You can also freeze leftover gumbo in a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave when ready to serve.\\n',\n",
       " ' We love when a recipe gets steller reviews—especially when they come from those who have made it for a number of years with success.\\n',\n",
       " ' One Southern Living community member commented, \"I have made this recipe for years and it is the best gumbo I have ever had, hands down!\"\\n',\n",
       " ' While another said, \"I\\'ve made this recipe for the last 10+ years. Being a cajun myself (south of I10 😉 ) this is definitely close to home and also quick and easy for beginners. Definitely my go-to favorite. Let\\'s also mention my family devours it and nothing is left over!! It\\'s requested for holidays and get togethers all the time. Bon Appétit!\"\\n',\n",
